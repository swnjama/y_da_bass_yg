<h1>y da bass yg? </h1>
<p>started on a fateful day in math class in 2019 
my friend at the time, while working on a problem played 'the less i know the better (INSERT LINK)' and i got hooked </p>
<br> 
<p>
I've always wanted to play the guitar, for as long as I could remember, but after tame impala became my 2nd loved artist in 2021, I knew that I wanted to learn the bass ...

  I am obessed with the bass of the bass, i love how deep and mysterious it is and how it just adds to the the overall instrumentals of the guitar. I am also in love with how the bass sounds by itself and it can be independent of the guitar.

  well thats the bit of history behind the bass, I think i just want it to be something i can use to destress to maybe perform at Open Mic nights and just have fun, im not trying to be a complete professional but if I could get to a solid level of being able to perform any song on the bass that would be amazing
